## Project-Explained:

This Bash script merges multiple text files into a single output text file. It is particularly useful when you have several small text files and want to merge them into one file for easier reading or managing of data. Instead of manually copying and pasting content from multiple files, this script will automatically allow you to do so, and allows for it to be read in an easy format (not super messy when merged). It also ensures that only text files are processed and provides error messages if somethign was done incorrectly. It also has an implemented help feature for the bash command if you are unsure what to do.
